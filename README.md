# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java using Swing for the GUI. Two players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game declares a winner or a tie if all squares are filled without a winner. The interface is clean, intuitive, and easy to use.
